•	A complete financial management business suite, tracking business accounting, including modules for expenses, invoicing and business statistics.

•	Also manages a complete client database, which includes the contact information and appropriate financial statistics.

•	Further enables the creation and exporting of invoices and quotes to PDF. These PDFs can also be emailed directly to the client through SMTP. 

•	All data will be stored natively by default on the user’s device, to ensure sensitive financial information is secure and confidential. The database will be handled through MySQL and local server would be setup through the installation of XAMPP. An expanded feature would be for the client to store the database on their online servers.
